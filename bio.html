      <h1>What I Want out of Software Engineering</h1>
      <p>I really want to learn anything about computers. I really enjoy leaning about the parts of a computer and how they function and 
        work together. I want to learn why things work the way they do, and why computers are made the way that they are. I also really 
        enjoy the coding aspect of the class, it is interesting to me to learn the "behind the scenes" of a website or a video game, and 
        learning the logic and problem-solving aspect of it.
